<h1>Liquidity Voids and Price Magnets: Why Markets Snap Back Into Gaps</h1>

<p>A <strong>liquidity void</strong> is a price area where the market barely traded. It’s a thin, low-volume pocket created when price moves too fast for meaningful two-way activity. These voids act like <strong>magnets</strong>—price often returns to fill them because the auction wants to rebalance what it skipped over.</p>

<h2>What Creates a Liquidity Void?</h2>

<p>When buyers or sellers overwhelm the book, the market can rip through multiple price levels without trading much at each one. The result is a vertical, impulsive move with almost no rotation or absorption.</p>

<p>Typical causes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a news spike or scheduled release</li>
  <li>stop cascades dumping multiple levels instantly</li>
  <li>thin liquidity during off-hours sessions</li>
  <li>large players sweeping the book</li>
</ul>

<p>You saw how this ties into <a href="../market-basics/market-liquidity-basics.html">market liquidity</a> earlier. When the book is thin, the market leaves gaps behind.</p>

<h2>How Liquidity Voids Look on the Chart</h2>

<p>You don’t need special indicators. Liquidity voids are obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vertical candles with little to no overlap</li>
  <li>almost no wicks on either side</li>
  <li>price leaves a “hole” of untested levels</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the parts of the chart that look like the market teleported upward or downward instead of actually trading there.</p>

<h2>Why Liquidity Voids Pull Price Back</h2>

<p>A liquidity void is an <strong>unfinished auction</strong>. The market skipped prices where real two-way trading should’ve happened. It tends to come back because the auction wants balance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>traders trapped in the move want out</li>
  <li>countertrend players reload at better prices</li>
  <li>institutional players rebalance positions</li>
  <li>new participants step in where volume is missing</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the same logic behind <a href="../market-basics/inefficient-price-action.html">inefficient price action</a>. What’s rushed usually gets repaired later.</p>

<h2>How Price Fills a Liquidity Void</h2>

<p>Filling a void is not mysterious. Price returns into the gap and:</p>

<ol>
  <li>starts trading two-way again</li>
  <li>absorbs trapped orders</li>
  <li>tests levels that were skipped</li>
  <li>rebuilds normal volume</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the gap is filled, the market often continues in the original direction—but not always. Sometimes the fill is the end of the move.</p>

<h2>The Three Types of Liquidity Voids</h2>

<h3>1. News Voids</h3>
<p>Instant spikes. Often filled later the same day after volatility cools.</p>

<h3>2. Thin-Session Voids</h3>
<p>Created during low liquidity hours (overnight Globex). These fill frequently during regular trading hours when real volume appears.</p>

<h3>3. Stop-Run Voids</h3>
<p>Triggered by cascading stops. These often fill only partially before resuming trend.</p>

<h2>When Voids Don’t Get Filled</h2>

<p>Nothing in markets is 100%. Voids sometimes stay open for days or weeks. This usually happens when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the trend is extremely strong</li>
  <li>new fundamental information reprices the entire market</li>
  <li>liquidity vanishes, forcing the market to accept higher or lower prices</li>
</ul>

<p>But even then, most voids eventually see price return—just not immediately.</p>

<h2>How to Use Liquidity Voids in Your Trading</h2>

<h3>1. Don’t Chase Moves That Created the Void</h3>
<p>If price ripped vertically, buying right after is usually the worst possible timing.</p>

<h3>2. Look for Pullback Entries Into the Void</h3>
<p>Let the market correct back into the gap. Enter at the edges where trapped players are still active.</p>

<h3>3. Don’t Blindly Fade Voids</h3>
<p>The market fills voids on its own schedule—not yours. Fading just because “a gap exists” is how traders blow accounts.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p><strong>Liquidity voids</strong> show you where the market moved too fast to form a proper auction. Those skipped areas act like <strong>price magnets</strong>, pulling price back to restore balance. If you respect these gaps instead of trading inside the chaos that created them, you avoid the dumbest entries and catch cleaner moves.</p>
