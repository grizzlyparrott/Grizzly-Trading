  <h1>Stop Runs and Liquidity Hunts: Why Your Levels Get Tagged</h1>

  <p><strong>Stop runs and liquidity hunts</strong> are not conspiracy theories. They’re how bigger players find volume. Your stop is their entry ticket. If you don’t understand how and why stops get targeted, you’ll keep getting wicked out right before the real move starts.</p>

  <h2>What a Stop Run Actually Is</h2>

  <p>A stop run is a fast move through a cluster of obvious stop-loss orders. It’s not about “punishing retail” — it’s about <strong>unlocking liquidity</strong> at a price where large traders actually want to do business.</p>

  <p>This ties directly into <a href="../market-basics/market-liquidity-basics.html">market liquidity</a>. Stops are just pending market orders sitting above highs and below lows. Blow through them and you trigger forced buying or selling.</p>

  <h2>Why Liquidity Hunts Are Built Into the Auction</h2>

  <p>Big players need size. They can’t just hit buy or sell once and be done. They need:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>enough opposite flow to fill their orders</li>
    <li>a reason for other traders to step in</li>
    <li>a way to hide their intent while they build a position</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Running stops above a high or below a low creates that forced opposite flow and lets them fill bigger orders without advertising it.</p>

  <h2>What Stop Runs Look Like on the Chart</h2>

  <p>You’ve seen this a thousand times. A typical stop run has:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a fast spike through a prior high or low</li>
    <li>a cluster of wicks in one direction</li>
    <li>immediate rejection back inside the prior range</li>
    <li>volume that spikes during the wick, then calms down</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you combine this with your work on <a href="../market-basics/market-failure-patterns.html">market failure patterns</a>, the picture is obvious: the market just flushed a crowd and flipped.</p>

  <h2>Where Stop Runs and Liquidity Hunts Usually Happen</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Location</th>
        <th>Why Stops Cluster There</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Prior swing highs and lows</td>
        <td>Textbook “safe” stop locations everyone uses</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Breakout levels</td>
        <td>Traders pile in with tight stops just beyond the line</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Session highs/lows</td>
        <td>Obvious intraday reference points</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Round numbers</td>
        <td>Psych levels where lazy risk management lives</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>How Liquidity Hunts Tie Into Microstructure</h2>

  <p>Stop runs and liquidity hunts are just one expression of <a href="../market-basics/microstructure-imbalance.html">microstructure imbalance</a>. When the tape tilts one way but big players want the opposite side, they’ll often:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>let price push into an extreme</li>
    <li>trigger a cluster of stops</li>
    <li>use that burst of forced orders to fill in size</li>
  </ul>

  <p>From your screen, it looks like a fake breakout or breakdown. To them, it’s just shopping.</p>

  <h2>Why Your Levels Keep Getting Tagged</h2>

  <p>There are a few honest reasons you get nailed over and over:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you put stops exactly where every beginner puts them</li>
    <li>your stops are too tight relative to volatility</li>
    <li>you don’t factor in thin zones and <a href="../market-basics/liquidity-voids-price-magnets.html">liquidity voids</a></li>
    <li>you enter on the first break instead of waiting for proof</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It’s not personal. You’re just providing easy liquidity in obvious places.</p>

  <h2>How to Stop Feeding Stop Runs</h2>

  <h3>1. Stop Using the Most Obvious Stop Locations</h3>
  <p>If your stop sits one tick above a swing high or exactly at a round number, you’re volunteering to be liquidity. Give the market some breathing room.</p>

  <h3>2. Anchor Your Stops to Structure, Not Fear</h3>
  <p>Place stops where your idea is clearly wrong, not where it just hurts a little. That might mean smaller size and wider protection.</p>

  <h3>3. Wait for the Flush Before Entering</h3>
  <p>In a lot of cases, the best entry comes <em>after</em> a stop run, not before it. Let the liquidity hunt play out first, then trade the rotation back inside the range.</p>

  <h3>4. Size Down Around Obvious Liquidity Pools</h3>
  <p>If you insist on trading near prior highs and lows, don’t go max size right into the obvious trap zone.</p>

  <div class="highlight-box red">
    <h3>Obvious Stops Are Just Free Liquidity</h3>
    <p>The market isn't out to get you—unless you're making it easy. Lazy stops near obvious levels are magnets for liquidity hunts. Anchor your risk around real structure, or keep donating to traders who planned for your panic.</p>
