        <h1>Market Participants Basics: Who Really Moves the Markets</h1>

        <p>If you want to understand price action, you need to understand <strong>market participants basics</strong> first. Every bar on your chart is just different players fighting over price with different size, rules, and goals.</p>

        <h2>Why Market Participants Matter More Than Indicators</h2>
        <p>Indicators lag. Market participants and their orders are what actually move price. When a big player has to buy size, price gets pushed up. When weak hands puke at the lows, price whips back. That’s why you should care who is trading against you, not just what your RSI says.</p>

        <p>If you already read <a href="../futures-basics/what-makes-futures-move.html">what-makes-futures-move.html</a>, this is the next layer: who is behind those orders and why they show up where they do.</p>

        <h2>Types of Market Participants</h2>
        <p>Here are the main groups you need to know when you study market participants basics.</p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Participant Type</th>
              <th>Main Goal</th>
              <th>Typical Behavior</th>
              <th>Impact on Price</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Retail traders</td>
              <td>Speculate, grow small accounts</td>
              <td>Trade small size, chase moves, react late</td>
              <td>Provide liquidity to stronger hands, fuel squeezes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Day traders / prop traders</td>
              <td>Short-term profit, intraday edges</td>
              <td>Use tight stops, scale in/out intraday</td>
              <td>Drive noise and short-term volatility</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Hedge funds / asset managers</td>
              <td>Move big size for portfolios</td>
              <td>Work orders over time, use algorithms</td>
              <td>Create strong trends when they accumulate or distribute</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Commercial hedgers</td>
              <td>Reduce business risk</td>
              <td>Use futures/options to hedge inventory or exposure</td>
              <td>Often fade extremes, add liquidity at key levels</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Market makers / liquidity providers</td>
              <td>Earn spread and rebates</td>
              <td>Quote both sides, adjust quotes quickly</td>
              <td>Control spreads, absorb flow until they need to hedge</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Retail Traders: Small Size, Big Emotion</h2>
        <p>Retail traders are the smallest and loudest group. In terms of market participants basics, they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trade small size and use high leverage.</li>
          <li>Chase breakouts late and bail out at the lows.</li>
          <li>Overreact to news, social media, and recent P&amp;L.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They rarely move price directly, but they get run over. When you see obvious levels fail and then reverse hard, it’s often retail getting cleaned out, similar to the emotional mistakes covered in <a href="../market-basics/why-good-ideas-still-lose-money.html">why-good-ideas-still-lose-money.html</a>.</p>

        <h2>Prop Traders and Active Day Traders</h2>
        <p>Active day traders and prop traders trade larger size than most retail and focus on short-term edges:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They lean on liquidity, order flow, and volatility.</li>
          <li>They watch tools like the DOM, footprint, and tape more than news.</li>
          <li>They add a lot of intraday noise but also create clean moves around key levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to trade like this group, understanding depth-of-market in <a href="../platforms-tutorials/dom-trading-basics.html">dom-trading-basics.html</a> is mandatory.</p>

        <h2>Funds and Big Money: The True Drivers</h2>
        <p>Funds, asset managers, and large speculators are the core of market participants basics when it comes to real trend. They:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Trade huge size that can’t be hidden in one print.</li>
          <li>Use algorithms to slice orders into smaller pieces.</li>
          <li>Care about risk metrics, benchmarks, and macro themes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these players accumulate, you see steady buying on pullbacks, shrinking pullback depth, and value drifting higher. When they distribute, the opposite happens. Your job is to ride with them, not fade them blindly.</p>

        <h2>Commercial Hedgers: The Quiet Counterparty</h2>
        <p>Commercial hedgers are companies using markets to offset real-world risk: airlines hedging fuel, miners hedging metal, exporters hedging currency. In market participants basics, they matter because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They often step in when prices get extreme relative to their business needs.</li>
          <li>They don’t care about perfect entries; they care about locking in acceptable prices.</li>
          <li>Their flow can cap extremes or create sharp mean-reversion when combined with speculative positioning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Market Makers and Liquidity Providers</h2>
        <p>Market makers quote both bid and ask and adjust constantly to stay hedged. Key points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They tighten or widen spreads based on volatility and inventory risk.</li>
          <li>They don’t “pick direction” long-term; they care about spread and flow.</li>
          <li>When volatility spikes or liquidity vanishes, market makers widen out and you feel it as worse slippage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Combine this with what you learned in <a href="../market-basics/market-liquidity-basics.html">market-liquidity-basics.html</a> and <a href="../market-basics/what-is-slippage-in-trading.html">what-is-slippage-in-trading.html</a> to understand why your fills get ugly during news or thin sessions.</p>

        <h2>How These Participants Interact Around Key Levels</h2>
        <p>Now let’s tie the market participants basics together around a typical key level like prior day high:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Retail buys the breakout late with tight stops.</li>
          <li>Prop traders lean into the level, scalping both sides.</li>
          <li>Funds decide whether to add or unload depending on bigger context.</li>
          <li>Market makers adjust spreads and inventory risk as flow hits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result: fake breaks, squeezes, and trend moves all come from how these groups interact, not from a magic indicator.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Market Participants Basics in Your Trading</h2>
        <p>You’re not going to outsize the big players, so stop trying. Use market participants basics to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify when you’re acting like weak retail (chasing, panicking, oversized).</li>
          <li>Align with bigger flows instead of fading them blindly.</li>
          <li>Expect volatility spikes when different groups are forced to act at the same time (news, opens, closes).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The final step is simple: every time you take a trade, ask “who is likely on the other side and why?” If you keep that question tied to these <strong>market participants basics</strong>, your read on price action will be cleaner and your decisions will make more sense.</p>
