<h1>Weekend Data Drops & Platform Disconnect Policies in Prop Firms</h1>

<p>Weekend data drops and platform disconnects are a silent killer in prop trading. The market might be closed, but risk systems are still running — and if data fails or your platform loses connection at the wrong time, you can violate an account without taking a single trade. Prop firms won’t take responsibility unless the failure is on their side, so you need to understand how these policies work.</p>

<h2>Why Weekend Data Drops Happen</h2>
<p>During the weekend, futures markets are closed. That’s when brokers, data providers, and prop firms do maintenance. Because of this, two things can happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>data feed resets</strong> (common Sunday afternoons)</li>
  <li><strong>platform reconnect cycles</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If your platform tries to reconnect during these moments, orders or positions can behave unpredictably.</p>

<h2>How Prop Firms Handle Weekend Maintenance</h2>
<p>Most prop firms use three rules related to weekend data integrity:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You must be flat before the weekend</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Your brackets/stops must be canceled before market close</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Firms are not responsible for fills caused by stale orders</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>These are separate from weekend holding rules — those deal with <strong>positions</strong>. This article deals with <strong>data behavior and platform stability</strong>.</p>

<h2>Platform Disconnects: How They Trigger Violations</h2>
<p>Disconnects are dangerous because your platform and the firm’s server can go out of sync.</p>

<p>Disconnect violations happen when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>your platform shows flat but the firm shows an active order</li>
  <li>a bracket order fires after reconnecting</li>
  <li>a stale stop gets triggered from old data</li>
  <li>a market order gets stuck in limbo and fills late</li>
</ul>

<p>If this happens during high volatility or a gap, you can blow trailing drawdown instantly.</p>

<h2>Who Is Responsible for a Disconnect?</h2>
<p>Prop firms use a simple rule:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If it’s your internet or platform → your fault.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>If it’s their server → they may reimburse or fix the account.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>They check logs to see where the failure occurred. Unless the outage was firm-wide, they will almost always blame the trader.</p>

<h2>Common Disconnect Scenarios</h2>

<h3>1. Losing Internet Mid-Trade</h3>
<p>Your platform freezes. Orders may still be active on the firm’s server. When it reconnects, the trade might be deep in drawdown. Violation triggered.</p>

<h3>2. Platform Freezing During Volatility</h3>
<p>Platforms like NinjaTrader and Tradovate can lock up temporarily when volatility explodes. If your bracket executes late, you’re done.</p>

<h3>3. Stale Orders After Weekend Maintenance</h3>
<p>Your platform might show no orders, but the firm still has one sitting on the server. When the market opens, the order activates.</p>

<h3>4. Data Feed Dropping but Internet Still Connected</h3>
<p>This is the worst one, because the platform looks alive. You enter a trade into dead data and get filled at a terrible price once the feed reconnects.</p>

<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Always flatten and clear working orders on Friday</li>
  <li>Restart your platform every Sunday before opening</li>
  <li>Use a wired connection during active trading</li>
  <li>Keep your phone hotspot ready for emergencies</li>
  <li>Disable automation near the weekend</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules complement the logic you see in <a href="news-trading-restrictions.html">news-trading restrictions</a> — both are about reducing unpredictable risk.</p>

<h2>Do Firms Ever Reset Accounts After Disconnects?</h2>
<p>Some do, but only if the outage was on their side and affected many traders simultaneously. If it’s only you, they assume it was user error.</p>

<h2>Final Takeaway</h2>
<p>Weekend data drops and platform disconnects are a real threat. Prop firms expect you to manage your own technical stability. If your platform loses connection or your data drops, the firm will hold you responsible — even if the market was closed. Stay flat, clear orders, and treat every weekend like a maintenance risk window.</p>
