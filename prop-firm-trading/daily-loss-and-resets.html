    <h2>1. Daily Loss Limit vs Trailing Drawdown</h2>
    <p>Most futures prop firms use two separate risk numbers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily loss limit</strong> – how much you can lose in a single trading day.</li>
        <li><strong>Trailing drawdown</strong> – the max distance between your peak balance and lowest closed balance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you do not fully get trailing drawdown, read  
        <a href="/Grizzly-Trading/prop-firm-trading/trailing-drawdown-explained.html">Trailing Drawdown Explained</a>  
        and  
        <a href="/Grizzly-Trading/prop-firm-trading/apex-style-rules-by-the-numbers.html">Apex-Style Rules by the Numbers</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Real Reset Trigger</h2>
    <p>You need a reset when either of these happens:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You hit or pass the firm’s <strong>daily loss limit</strong>.</li>
        <li>Your account equity drops below the <strong>trailing drawdown</strong> line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Most traders focus on the daily loss line and forget that the trailing drawdown
        is quietly walking up behind them. That is why a big winner followed by a big
        loser can violate the trailing rule even if the daily loss looks fine.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How Much Can You Actually Lose in One Day?</h2>
    <p>Example: $50k eval with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$3,000 profit target</li>
        <li>$2,500 trailing drawdown</li>
        <li>$1,100 advertised daily loss limit</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On paper you can lose $1,100. In practice you should not get anywhere near that.</p>
    <p>
        A safer personal rule: keep daily loss under <strong>10–15% of trailing drawdown</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>10% of $2,500 = $250</li>
        <li>15% of $2,500 = $375</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        That number fits the game plan from  
        <a href="/Grizzly-Trading/prop-firm-trading/prop-evaluation-game-plan.html">Prop Firm Evaluation Game Plan</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Daily Loss and Trailing Drawdown Working Together</h2>
    <p>Two simple rules keep the account from blowing up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never let closed PnL for the day go past your personal daily loss limit.</li>
        <li>Keep a running mental picture of how far the trailing drawdown has moved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Every time you make a new high-water mark, the trailing drawdown ratchets up.
        Your next losing day has less room than the one before.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Reset Math: When Is It Worth Paying?</h2>
    <p>Resets are basically a tax on giving back the edge you already proved you have.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you break rules on day 1–2 with no progress, reset is just the cost of learning.</li>
        <li>If you were 70–80% to the target and blew it, you paid to go backward.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The whole point of having a tight personal daily loss is to avoid resets in the
        first place, not to get cheaper ones.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Setting Your Own Daily Loss Limit</h2>
    <p>Simple formula that works across sizes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take the firm’s <strong>trailing drawdown</strong> number.</li>
        <li>Multiply by 0.10 to 0.15.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>$1,000 trailing drawdown → $100–$150 personal daily loss.</li>
        <li>$2,500 trailing drawdown → $250–$375 personal daily loss.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Use the same risk-per-trade logic from  
        <a href="/Grizzly-Trading/market-basics/risk-per-trade-small-accounts.html">Risk Per Trade for Small Accounts</a>  
        to split that daily loss into 3–5 trades.
    </p>

    <h2>7. A Hard Stop Rule for the Day</h2>
    <p>End-of-day rules that keep you from needing resets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If closed PnL hits your personal daily loss, you are done.</li>
        <li>If you reach daily profit equal to 5–10% of your total profit target, you can be done.</li>
        <li>Max trades per day: usually 3–5. After that, platform gets closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This plugs directly into the structure in  
        <a href="/Grizzly-Trading/prop-firm-trading/common-evaluation-mistakes.html">Common Evaluation Mistakes</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. What Happens After a Reset</h2>
    <p>After you pay for a reset:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account balance and drawdown rules go back to day one.</li>
        <li>Your bad habits do not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The only way a reset is not a waste is if you come back with a completely
        different set of rules and discipline than you had before.
