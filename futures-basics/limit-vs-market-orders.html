        <h1>Limit vs Market Orders – When To Use Which</h1>
        <p class="section-intro">
            Every futures trader uses these two order types, but most don’t actually understand the trade-offs.
            Here’s the real difference and when you should use each one.
        </p>

        <h2>What a Market Order Actually Does</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>market order</strong> says: “Fill me right now at the best available price.”  
            Execution is guaranteed. Price is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you hit market buy, you take whatever sell orders are sitting on the ask.
            When you market sell, you hit the bids.
        </p>

        <h3>Market Orders Are Best For:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting into a fast-moving setup immediately</li>
            <li>Exiting a losing trade right away</li>
            <li>Small size (1–4 lots) where slippage is minor</li>
            <li>When spread = 1 tick (most of ES/NQ/MES during RTH)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Market Order Downsides</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can get slipped multiple ticks in low liquidity</li>
            <li>News spikes can blow straight past your intended level</li>
            <li>Larger size = more slippage</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What a Limit Order Actually Does</h2>
        <p>
            A <strong>limit order</strong> says: “Fill me, but only at this price or better.”  
            Price is guaranteed. Execution is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            If price tags your limit order but size doesn’t trade through it,
            you won’t be filled. That’s the “queue.”
        </p>

        <h3>Limit Orders Are Best For:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Entries where exact price matters</li>
            <li>High volatility markets with big spread or fast candles</li>
            <li>Scaling into positions</li>
            <li>Trading levels (FVGs, liquidity zones, VWAP re-tests)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limit Order Downsides</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not guaranteed to fill even if price hits your level</li>
            <li>You can miss an entire move waiting for the “perfect” price</li>
            <li>You may get partial fills on certain platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>So Which Should You Use?</h2>

        <h3>Use Market When:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to get in or out **now**</li>
            <li>You’re trading small size</li>
            <li>Spread is 1 tick and liquidity is strong</li>
            <li>You’re stopping out of a losing position</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Use Limit When:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You want price precision</li>
            <li>You’re entering a level and expecting a reaction</li>
            <li>Liquidity is thin or volatile</li>
            <li>You’re scaling into a swing or scalp</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Real Rule Traders Use</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Market to exit. Limit to enter.</strong>  
            Not always, but it’s the cleanest rule of thumb for beginners.
