<h1>Common Chart Patterns That Actually Show Up in 6A AUD/USD Futures</h1>

<p>
Most textbook chart patterns are fantasy land. 6A AUD/USD futures only respect a handful of patterns consistently, and they behave differently depending on the session and volatility. If you stick to the patterns that actually form in live market conditions, your win rate instantly improves.
</p>

<h2>Why 6A forms reliable patterns</h2>

<p>
6A has clean structure because AUD is flow-driven and respects global session timing. You get clear consolidations, aggressive breakouts, and predictable retests. These patterns line up with the volatility bursts explained in <a href="6a-volatility-clusters.html">6a-volatility-clusters.html</a>.
</p>

<h2>1. Compression Breakouts</h2>

<p>
6A loves to coil into tight ranges before breaking out during Tokyo or New York. The pattern is simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lower highs + higher lows</li>
  <li>Volume dries up</li>
  <li>Breakout hits with a clean burst</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first pullback after the break is usually the real entry—not the breakout candle.
</p>

<h2>2. Retest Breakouts (the most reliable pattern in 6A)</h2>

<p>
A level breaks → price pulls back → level holds → trend continues.  
6A does this all day long across every timeframe.  
Works especially well during risk-on days where AUD is bid.
</p>

<h2>3. Failed Breakouts (classic during London chop)</h2>

<p>
London loves to fake breaks on 6A, especially inside wider ranges.  
Tell-tale signs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Breakout candle closes weak</li>
  <li>Volume doesn’t follow</li>
  <li>Price snaps back into structure</li>
</ul>

<p>
Short the failed breakout if it’s against the broader sentiment—see <a href="risk-sentiment-6a-trends.html">risk-sentiment-6a-trends.html</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Trend Channel Continuations</h2>

<p>
6A often trends inside ascending or descending channels.  
Best approach:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy near channel support during risk-on days</li>
  <li>Sell near channel resistance during risk-off days</li>
</ul>

<p>
Breakouts from channels usually run for 20–40 ticks on decent volatility.
</p>

<h2>5. Double Tops and Double Bottoms (Sydney and Tokyo special)</h2>

<p>
These form during low–medium liquidity sessions when price taps the same level twice.  
They’re not reversal patterns because of magic—they’re just liquidity grabs.
</p>

<p>
The retest after the second touch is the actual entry.
</p>

<h2>Table: Which patterns work best in each session?</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Session</th>
      <th>Most Common Patterns</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sydney</td>
      <td>Double tops/bottoms, slow channels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tokyo</td>
      <td>Compression breakouts, clean break-and-retest</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>London</td>
      <td>Fakeouts, failed breakouts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>New York</td>
      <td>Trend breakouts, aggressive expansions</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>
6A doesn’t care about fancy chart patterns. It respects compression, breakouts, retests, channel structure, and liquidity flips. Stick to the patterns that actually show up in futures—not the ones drawn in trading books—and you’ll finally stop forcing trades that don’t exist.
