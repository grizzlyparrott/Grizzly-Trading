<h1>GC Correlations: DXY, Yields, and Risk Assets</h1>

<p>
Gold futures (GC) do not move in isolation. They follow a small set of macro relationships that repeat again and again. If you do not understand GC’s correlations, you are effectively trading blind, because these relationships explain the majority of GC’s trend direction.
</p>

<h2>The Number One GC Correlation: Real Yields</h2>

<p>
If you understand nothing else, understand this:  
<strong>GC moves opposite real yields.</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>When real yields rise, GC tends to move lower</li>
  <li>When real yields fall, GC tends to move higher</li>
</ul>

<p>
Real yields are nominal Treasury yields adjusted for inflation expectations.  
This relationship forms the backbone of nearly every major GC move.
</p>

<h2>The Second GC Correlation: The U.S. Dollar (DXY)</h2>

<p>
GC is priced in U.S. dollars per ounce.  
When <a href="dxy-impact-on-gc.html">the dollar strengthens</a>, gold becomes more expensive globally, which usually pushes GC lower.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>When DXY strengthens, GC is typically pressured lower</li>
  <li>When DXY weakens, GC often finds support</li>
</ul>

<p>
This relationship only weakens when real yields completely dominate the macro environment, such as during aggressive tightening cycles.
</p>

<h2>GC and Bonds (ZB, ZN)</h2>

<p>
GC tracks bonds because both respond to interest rates and inflation expectations. When bond prices rise and yields fall, GC usually rises alongside them.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rising bond prices are usually accompanied by rising GC</li>
  <li>Falling bond prices are usually accompanied by falling GC</li>
</ul>

<p>
GC, bonds, and real yields form a <a href="gc-fundamental-drivers.html">triangular macro relationship</a> that must be monitored daily.
</p>

<h2>GC and Equity Markets (ES, NQ)</h2>

<p>
GC and equities share a weak inverse relationship that only becomes reliable during genuine risk-off environments.
</p>

<p>
Under normal conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rising equity markets usually have little impact on GC</li>
  <li>Falling equity markets may provide mild support for GC</li>
</ul>

<p>
During panic, credit stress, geopolitical shocks, or liquidity events, GC can temporarily act as a hedge and rally sharply while equities sell off.
</p>

<h2>GC and Risk Assets (Crude Oil, Copper, Crypto)</h2>

<p>
GC is not a risk-on asset like crude oil or copper.  
It is also not a liquidity-driven speculative asset like Bitcoin.
</p>

<p>
However, correlations still exist:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Crude Oil (CL):</strong> acts as an inflation proxy and can support GC when inflation expectations rise</li>
  <li><strong>Copper (HG):</strong> reflects economic growth and often moves opposite GC during slowdowns</li>
  <li><strong>Crypto:</strong> shows a weak and inconsistent relationship, with both reacting to liquidity in very different ways</li>
</ul>

<p>
GC trades macro stability.  
Risk assets trade growth expectations and liquidity conditions.
</p>

<h2>GC and the VIX (Volatility Index)</h2>

<p>
GC correlates with the VIX only during genuine fear-driven events.  
Normal volatility spikes do not reliably push GC higher.
</p>

<p>
For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the VIX rises above thirty while yields are falling, GC often rallies aggressively</li>
  <li>When the VIX rises above thirty while yields are rising, GC often stalls or moves lower</li>
</ul>

<p>
Risk-off conditions combined with falling yields provide fuel for GC rallies.  
Risk-off conditions combined with rising yields usually result in confusion and choppy price action.
</p>

<h2>GC and Inflation Data</h2>

<p>
GC reacts violently to CPI, PCE, and shifts in inflation expectations. However, the reaction depends on context.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>GC tends to rally when inflation accelerates faster than yields</li>
  <li>GC tends to sell off when yields rise faster than inflation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Inflation by itself does not drive GC. The relationship between inflation and yields does.
</p>

<h2>How to Use These Correlations in Real Trading</h2>

<h3>1. Check real yields every morning</h3>
<p>
When real yields are rising, long GC trades carry lower probability.  
When real yields are falling, GC longs are favored.
</p>

<h3>2. Track DXY intraday</h3>
<p>
Sharp rallies in the dollar can kill GC breakouts almost instantly.
</p>

<h3>3. Use bonds as confirmation</h3>
<p>
If GC and Treasury bonds are diverging, something in the macro picture is off.
</p>

<h3>4. Only trust GC and equity inverse behavior during real fear</h3>
<p>
Normal equity weakness does not guarantee GC strength.
</p>

<h3>5. Watch correlations during major news events</h3>
<p>
After CPI or NFP releases, when both real yields and the dollar fall together, GC often prints its cleanest trend of the month.
</p>

<div class="highlight-box green">
  <h3>GC Follows Real Yields and the Dollar</h3>
  <p>Gold is not guessing. It is tracking macro inputs. Real yields and the dollar lead the move. Everything else is secondary. Get the correlations right, and GC starts making sense.</p>
