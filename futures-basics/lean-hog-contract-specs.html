        <h1>Contract Specs That Matter in Lean Hog Trading</h1>

        <p>
          Lean hog futures (HE) are simple to quote and brutal to mis-size. Most traders don’t get hurt because they “read the chart wrong.” They get hurt because they don’t know what one tick is worth, how fast this contract can travel, and what changes as expiration gets close. If you don’t know the code format yet, start with <a href="futures-symbols-and-contract-codes-explained.html">futures symbols and contract codes</a> so you can read HEJ6 / HEV6 without guessing.
        </p>

        <p>
          This page is a trader’s spec sheet. It focuses on the parts that directly hit P&amp;L and execution. For the broader framework, see <a href="futures-contract-specifications-explained.html">contract specifications explained</a>, and for the “don’t get caught in the dead contract” part, see <a href="futures-rollover-explained.html">futures rollover explained</a>.

        <h2>HE Quick Specs</h2>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Spec</th>

            </tr>

              <td>$400 per contract (a 1.00 move = one cent per pound)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Price limits</td>
              <td>Subject to daily price limits; the limit size can change, so check the exchange/broker calendar before holding risk into reports</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Expiration risk</td>
              <td>Do not treat HE like an index future. Liquidity and behavior change sharply as the active month rolls and the contract approaches settlement</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Contract Size and Dollar Exposure</h2>

        <p>
          The 40,000-pound contract size is the whole game. It’s why a move that looks “small” on the quote screen is not small in dollars. If you size HE the way you size something slower, you’ll discover the mistake in one session.
        </p>

        <p>
          The clean mental math is this: 1 tick is $10. A 10-tick move is $100. A 50-tick move is $500. A 100-tick move is $1,000. HE can do that without asking permission.
        </p>

        <h2>Tick Size and Tick Value</h2>

        <p>
          HE trades in 0.00025 increments per pound. With 40,000 pounds, that’s $10 per tick. This is the part that decides whether your stop is real protection or a decorative suggestion.
        </p>

        <p>
          A lot of traders screw this up by thinking in “points” like index futures. In hogs, a 1.00 move is one cent per pound, and that’s $400 per contract. If you don’t internalize that, you’ll keep putting on “one-lot” positions that are not one-lot risk.
        </p>

        <h2>Liquidity and Execution Reality</h2>

        <p>
          HE liquidity concentrates in the active/nearby contract. When you drift into a thin month, spreads widen, fills get worse, and your stop becomes a slippage lottery. This gets more pronounced as the market approaches rollover and as attention shifts to the next liquid month.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you want clean execution, trade where the volume is. If you want to learn what pain feels like, trade a dead month because the chart “looks smoother.”
        </p>

        <h2>Price Limits and “You Can’t Get Out” Risk</h2>

        <p>
          Lean hogs can be subject to daily price limits. When a market is pinned near a limit, liquidity can dry up and exits become theoretical. That’s not drama. That’s how limit behavior works.
        </p>

        <p>
          The practical takeaway is simple: don’t treat HE like a contract you can always flatten instantly, especially around major reports or headline risk. Before you hold size, verify the current limit rules and your broker’s risk controls.
        </p>

        <h2>Settlement and Expiration Behavior</h2>

        <p>
          HE is not a “set it and forget it” contract near the end of the cycle. Whether the final mechanism is cash settlement or another structure, what matters to you is that expiration is a different environment than mid-cycle trading. Liquidity can shift, pricing behavior can change, and weird P&amp;L swings show up if you hold risk when the contract is transitioning out of being the main trading vehicle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your rule is to be early, not brave. Know when liquidity migrates and be out of the way before the contract becomes an execution trap.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Margin Is a Terrible Risk Signal</h2>

        <p>
          Margin tells you what you’re allowed to hold. It does not tell you what you should hold. HE can move enough in a session to blow through a day trader’s pain threshold long before margin becomes the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you size off margin, you’re outsourcing risk thinking to the least conservative number on the screen.
        </p>

          <h3>Lean Hog Specs Explain the Violence</h3>
          <p>
            HE doesn’t feel random when you respect the mechanics. Contract size, $10 ticks, liquidity concentration, and limit behavior explain why this market can move fast and punish sloppy sizing. The chart isn’t lying. Your position size is.
