                        Futures leverage is simple: you control a big notional position with a relatively small margin deposit. 
                        The problem is most new traders only see the buying power boost and ignore the risk. 
                        This guide breaks down futures leverage in plain English so you know what you’re actually putting on the line.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What Is Futures Leverage, Really?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Futures leverage is the ratio between the contract’s notional value (what the position is “worth”) and the margin you have to post to hold it. 
                        You are not “borrowing money” the same way you do with stock margin. 
                        You are posting performance bond so the exchange knows you can cover losses as price moves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Example: if one contract is worth $200,000 and the exchange requires $10,000 of initial margin, you are trading with 20:1 leverage. 
                        Every price move is based on the $200,000, not the $10,000 you posted.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Pieces of the Futures Leverage Puzzle</h2>
                    <p>Three numbers matter for every futures position:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contract size:</strong> how much the contract is worth per point or per unit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notional value:</strong> contract size multiplied by the current price.</li>
                        <li><strong>Margin requirement:</strong> the initial and maintenance margin set by the exchange and your broker.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If you don’t know these three, you’re trading blind. 
                        If you need a refresher on what a futures contract actually is, read 
                        <a href="what-is-a-futures-contract.html">what is a futures contract</a> first, then come back here.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Example: Futures Leverage in Action</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here’s a simple comparison using made-up but realistic numbers. 
                        The exact margin levels change over time, but the logic stays the same.
                    </p>

                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>ES (S&amp;P 500 E-mini)</td>
                                <td>$200,000</td>
                                <td>$10,000</td>
                                <td>20:1</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>MES (Micro ES)</td>
                                <td>$20,000</td>
                                <td>$1,000</td>
                                <td>20:1</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>NQ (Nasdaq E-mini)</td>
                                <td>$300,000</td>
                                <td>$15,000</td>
                                <td>20:1</td>
                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <p>
                        The leverage ratio is roughly the same, but the <strong>dollar</strong> risk per tick is smaller on the micro contracts. 
                        That’s why new traders should usually start with micros, not full-size contracts.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Where Futures Leverage Shows Up in Your P&amp;L</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every tick is multiplied by the contract value, not your margin. 
                        If a contract moves 10 points and each point is $50 per contract, that is a $500 swing per contract, win or lose. 
                        Leverage makes those swings big relative to your account size.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you don’t already understand how ticks, points, and dollar value work, read 
                        <a href="ticks-points-dollar-value.html">ticks, points, and dollar value</a> so these numbers stop being random.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Futures Leverage and Account Size</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most brokers will tell you the minimum account size to trade a contract. 
                        Ignore that. They’re trying to maximize their commissions, not protect you.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Risk per trade should usually be 0.5%–1% of your account, not 5%–10%.</li>
                        <li>Work backward from your stop size in ticks to see how many contracts you can trade.</li>
                        <li>If one contract risks too much, drop to a micro contract or sit out.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Common Futures Leverage Mistakes</h2>
                    <h3>1. Thinking Margin = Maximum Loss</h3>
                    <p>
                        Margin is <strong>not</strong> your max loss. 
                        It’s the minimum your broker wants you to keep in the account so they feel safe letting you hold the trade. 
                        The market can move far past that and nuke your entire account if you size stupidly.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Scaling Up Just Because Margin Allows It</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just because your broker lets you hold 5 contracts doesn’t mean your account can survive 5 full-stop losses. 
                        Leverage should be earned with consistent performance, not taken on day one “because it’s available.”
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Ignoring Overnight Risk</h3>
                    <p>
                        Day margin is usually lower than overnight margin. 
                        Once you hold past the cutoff, your required margin jumps. 
                        If you’re maxed out on day margin and forget, you can get hit with a forced liquidation at the worst possible spot.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to Use Futures Leverage Without Blowing Up</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with micro contracts until your risk management is boring and consistent.</li>
                        <li>Plan your stop distance first, then calculate position size.</li>
                        <li>Keep total open risk small enough that several losing trades won’t cripple you.</li>
                        <li>Avoid holding into major news if your account is small. Leverage + volatility is a bad combo.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts: Respect Futures Leverage or It Will Humble You</h2>
                    <p>
                        Futures leverage is not evil; it’s just brutal if you don’t respect it. 
                        It lets a small account control serious notional value, but the same leverage that boosts winners will also amplify every mistake. 
                        Understand how futures leverage works, size your trades off risk instead of greed, and it becomes a tool instead of a wrecking ball.
