            <h1>Futures Leverage Explained: How Much Buying Power You Really Have</h1>

            <p>
                Futures leverage is the reason tiny accounts can control huge notional value. 
                It’s also the reason most new traders blow up in a weekend. 
                If you don’t understand how leverage, margin, and <a href="breakeven-futures.html">break-even math</a> fit together, you’re gambling, not trading.
            </p>

            <h2>What Futures Leverage Really Is</h2>
            <p>
                With stocks, you usually pay the full price (or use limited margin like 2:1).  
                With futures, you only post a <strong>margin deposit</strong>, but you are exposed to the full contract value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The market doesn’t care that you only put up $500. 
                It moves the same amount in ticks. 
                Whether that move is a paper cut or a death blow depends on your leverage.
            </p>

            <h2>The Basic Leverage Formula</h2>
            <p>
                There’s a simple way to see how “juiced” you are on a single contract:
            </p>
            <p><strong>Leverage = Contract Notional Value ÷ Margin Requirement</strong></p>
            <p>
                To get the notional value, you use the <a href="contract-specs-explained.html">contract specs</a>:
                price × multiplier.
            </p>

            <h2>Example: MES with Real Numbers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>MES multiplier: $5</li>
                <li>Assume the S&amp;P is trading at 5000</li>
                <li>Contract notional = 5000 × 5 = $25,000</li>
                <li>Your broker’s day margin for MES: $500 (typical for a retail futures broker)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now plug that in:
            </p>
            <p>
                25,000 ÷ 500 = <strong>50:1 leverage</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                That means a 1% move in the index is a 50% swing on the cash you put up.  
                That’s why “it only moved a little” can wipe out your account if you oversize.
            </p>

            <h2>How Leverage Shows Up in Your P&amp;L</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of thinking in ratios, look at it in ticks and dollars:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>MES tick value: $1.25</li>
                <li>20-tick move = $25 per contract</li>
                <li>80-tick move = $100 per contract</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On paper, 80 ticks might look like “just a pullback.”  
                On a small account using 4 MES contracts, that same move is:
            </p>
            <p><strong>80 ticks × $1.25 × 4 contracts = $400</strong></p>
            <p>
                If you’re trading a $1,000 account that way, you’re one bad trade away from being done.
            </p>

            <h2>Exchange Margin vs Broker Day Margin</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main types of margin you’ll see:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Exchange margin:</strong> the official requirement set by the exchange (CME, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Broker day margin:</strong> the discounted requirement your broker gives you during regular trading hours.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The exchange margin is usually higher and based on volatility and risk models.  
                The broker day margin is designed to let you trade more contracts intraday, as long as you flatten before the close.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you hold overnight, you’re usually bumped back up toward exchange margin, 
                which is why brokers sometimes liquidate positions heading into the close if you’re too heavy.
            </p>

            <h2>Leverage and Your Account Size</h2>
            <p>
                There are two questions that actually matter:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How much can I lose on one trade without emotionally imploding?</li>
                <li>How many trades like that can I survive in a row?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You answer both with position size, not with dreams of what 20 leveraged wins in a row would look like.
            </p>

            <h3>Practical Sizing Example</h3>
            <p>
                Assume:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>$2,000 account</li>
                <li>Risk per trade: 1% of account = $20</li>
                <li>Stop size on MES: 10 ticks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With $1.25 per tick on MES:
            </p>
            <p>
                10 ticks × $1.25 = $12.50 per contract  
                $20 ÷ 12.50 ≈ 1.6 → <strong>you can trade 1 contract comfortably</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s the math nobody wants to hear, but it’s why most people shouldn’t be slinging 5 MES on a tiny account.
            </p>

            <h2>How Leverage Interacts with Break-Even</h2>
            <p>
                Leverage doesn’t change your <strong>break-even ticks</strong>.  
                That’s determined by your tick value and costs.  
                But high leverage makes it much easier to hit your max daily loss or your account floor when trades go against you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you don’t already know how many ticks you need just to cover commissions, 
                go read <a href="breakeven-futures.html">Break-Even Math for Futures Traders</a> and then come back.
            </p>

            <h2>Common Leverage Mistakes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sizing based on how many contracts the broker lets you open instead of your risk per trade.</li>
                <li>Ignoring the difference between day margin and overnight margin.</li>
                <li>Trading multiple correlated markets (like MES and NQ) as if they are separate risk.</li>
                <li>Doubling size after a loss to “win it back” with the same stop distance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Leverage doesn’t change the chart, it changes how fast your equity swings.</li>
                <li>Notional value is the real exposure; margin is just your buy-in to sit at the table.</li>
                <li>Sane risk per trade will always cap how much leverage you can safely use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you respect leverage, futures become a flexible tool. 
                If you treat it like a shortcut, you’re just speeding up how fast the market takes your money.
            </p>
