<h1>Registered vs Eligible COMEX Silver Explained (And Why It Matters for SI Futures)</h1>

<p>
If you trade Silver futures (SI) and don’t understand COMEX inventories, you’re missing the structural risk behind the chart. Price is not just candles and levels; it’s tied to how much silver is actually sitting in COMEX warehouses, who owns it, and how much is available to back delivery. This isn’t tinfoil-hat stuff—this is how the plumbing of the SI contract works.
</p>

<h2>What COMEX Inventories Actually Are</h2>
<div class="highlight-box blue">
  <strong>Registered silver = deliverable. Eligible silver = not deliverable.</strong>
</div>

<p>
COMEX inventories are the silver bars held in exchange-approved warehouses that can be used to settle SI futures contracts. Think of it as the “physical backing” sitting behind a financial market that mostly cash-settles but is <em>capable</em> of delivery.
</p>

<p>
Two main labels matter:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Eligible silver</strong> – Good-delivery bars sitting in the system, but not currently pledged against SI futures delivery.</li>
  <li><strong>Registered silver</strong> – Bars specifically tagged as available for delivery against SI futures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Everyone on social media screams about “total COMEX inventory,” but for futures risk, <strong>registered inventory</strong> is what matters most.
</p>

<h2>Registered vs Eligible: Why the Difference Matters</h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Category</th><th>What It Means</th><th>Impact on SI</th></tr>
<tr><td>Eligible</td><td>Meets specs, not committed to delivery</td><td>Potential future backing, but optional</td></tr>
<tr><td>Registered</td><td>Officially available to fulfill futures</td><td>Directly backs open interest and delivery</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Low eligible with healthy registered = not ideal, but manageable.  
High eligible and low registered = big players <em>can</em> move metal into registered if needed, but might choose not to.  
Low registered <strong>and</strong> high open interest in nearby SI contracts? That’s where squeeze risk comes from.
</p>

<h2>How Inventory Levels Interact With Open Interest</h2>

<p>
You can’t judge inventories in a vacuum. You match them against <strong>open interest</strong> in the front-month SI contracts.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If registered silver is huge compared to open interest → low squeeze risk.</li>
  <li>If registered silver is tight compared to open interest → squeeze risk rises.</li>
  <li>If registered silver falls rapidly into a delivery month → market pays attention, even if price doesn’t jump instantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is where the “paper vs physical” narrative comes from, but you don’t need to join that religion. You just track:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is registered inventory rising or falling?</li>
  <li>Is open interest expanding into that drop?</li>
  <li>Are spreads and front-month prices reacting?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Drawdowns, Restocking, and Price Behavior</h2>

<p>
COMEX inventories don’t move tick-by-tick with SI, but big trends in inventory <em>do</em> shape narrative and risk pricing.
</p>

<h3>When Registered Inventories Fall</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Metal is leaving the exchange system.</li>
  <li><strong>Story:</strong> Either investment demand, off-exchange deals, or refinery flows are pulling silver out.</li>
  <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Squeeze chatter rises, firms get more cautious shorting aggressively into lows.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Registered Inventories Rise</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signal:</strong> Metal is being added back, often from eligible or external flows.</li>
  <li><strong>Story:</strong> Producers or large holders are comfortable parking silver on-exchange.</li>
  <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Reduces “tightness” narrative, makes prolonged short-covering moves less likely.</li>
</ul>

<p>
None of this overrides short-term drivers like dollar strength or CPI shocks—which you already saw in <a href="how-dollar-strength-impacts-si-price.html">How Dollar Strength Impacts SI Price Movement</a> and <a href="us-economic-data-that-moves-si.html">U.S. Economic Data That Moves SI</a>. Inventories are the background, not the spark.
</p>

<h2>How Inventories Feed Into Squeeze Risk</h2>

<p>
A classic silver squeeze setup looks something like this:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Registered inventories trending lower over months.</li>
  <li>Strong industrial and investment demand building in the background.</li>
  <li>Front-month open interest stays high into delivery.</li>
  <li>Shorts bet on “plenty of metal” that doesn’t actually exist in registered form.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If longs decide to stand for delivery instead of rolling out, shorts are cornered:  
they either find metal, buy back futures at ugly prices, or reshuffle exposure elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Does this happen every month? No.  
Can it happen when conditions line up? Yes.  
Your job is not to scream “squeeze” every week—it’s to recognize when the <em>setup</em> actually makes sense.
</p>

<h2>Why Inventories Don’t Explain Every SI Move</h2>

<p>
Retail traders love to blame “suppression” anytime SI drops while inventories fall. Reality is more boring:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>SI trades on macro conditions first (dollar, rates, risk).</li>
  <li>Industrial demand shifts change medium-term direction.</li>
  <li>COMEX inventories change the <em>risk profile</em> of those moves, not the spark.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You saw the demand side in <a href="industrial-demand-and-si-futures.html">Industrial Demand and SI Futures</a>. Inventories are the other half of the long-term tug-of-war: how much metal is actually floating around and how quickly can it show up on-exchange.
</p>

<h2>Practical Use: How a Trader Should Treat COMEX Silver Inventories</h2>

<p>
Here’s how to use COMEX inventory data like a trader, not a conspiracy theorist:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Trend, not tick:</strong> Watch multi-week inventory trends, not day-to-day noise.</li>
  <li><strong>Registered vs open interest:</strong> Squeeze risk rises when registered stocks fall while front-month OI stays heavy.</li>
  <li><strong>Context first:</strong> Tight inventories <em>plus</em> dollar weakness <em>plus</em> strong demand = serious upside risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Spread behavior:</strong> Watch SI spreads for signs of stress—front months going bid relative to back months.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you’re intraday scalping SI, inventories won’t tell you where to put your stop. That’s where contract mechanics and ATR come in, which I break down in <a href="si-volatility-and-atr-profile.html">SI Volatility and ATR Profile</a>. Inventories matter most when you’re:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>holding swing positions across months</li>
  <li>trading spreads</li>
  <li>deciding how aggressive you want to be short into structural tightness</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box green">
  <h3>Silver Inventories Are a Structural Risk Gauge</h3>
  <p>Registered vs eligible, drawdowns, and open interest aren’t noise — they show how fragile SI really is. Track inventories with macro and demand, and the “nonsense” moves start making perfect sense.</p>
